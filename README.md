# SimmaTest iOS Project #

## Getting Started ##
To get started with the SimmaTest iOS project, follow these steps:


### Prerequisites ###
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with the latest SDK.
* Swift/Objective-C knowledge.
* Cocoapods installed for managing dependencies.


### Cloning the Repository ### 

* Open `Xcode`.
* Go to the `Source Control Navigator`:
  - You can find this on the left-hand side of the Xcode window. It looks like a square icon with lines inside.
* Click on the `Clone an existing project` button.
* In the pop-up window, enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/EnasAbdallahAwd/SimmaTest`.
  - If the repository is private, make sure to select the appropriate option and enter your credentials.
* Choose a local directory where you want to clone the repository.
* Click `Clone`.
* If the repository requires authentication, provide your `Git credentials`.
  - If you're using a version control system like GitHub, you might need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password.
* Wait for Xcode to complete the cloning process.
  - You should now see the project in your Xcode workspace.




### Running the App ### 

* Open the Xcode workspace.
* Connect your iOS `device or start a simulator`.
* Select the target device.
* Click the `Run` button or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + R`.
* The app should now be running on your device/simulator.
